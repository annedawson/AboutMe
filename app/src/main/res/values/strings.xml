    <string name="bio">Hello, my name is Anne.
        \n\nI am a Computer Science instructor and
        \nAndroid App developer. I\'ve been
        \ndeveloping Android apps for a few years now.
        \nI\'ve been programming continually since the
        \nmid 1970\'s. My first programming languages
        \nwere BASIC, Fortran 77, Pascal and Algol 60.
        \nI went on to study C, C++ and later Java and Python.
        \nMy current programming language of choice is Kotlin.
        \nI\'m studying Android app development using Kotlin
        \nby completing Udacity/Google developed training
        \nmaterial and studying the wealth of information
        \navailable online.\n
        \nMy long term plan is to keep abreast of the
        \nlatest developments in Android and Kotlin so
        \nthat I can pass on my knowledge in the form
        \nof educational YouTube videos on my channel at
        \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/AnneDawson
